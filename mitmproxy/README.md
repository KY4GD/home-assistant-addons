# mitmproxy

[mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) is your swiss-army knife for debugging, testing, privacy measurements, and penetration testing. It can be used to intercept, inspect, modify and replay web traffic such as HTTP/1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, or any other SSL/TLS-protected protocols. You can prettify and decode a variety of message types ranging from HTML to Protobuf, intercept specific messages on-the-fly, modify them before they reach their destination, and replay them to a client or server later on.

This addon is based on the [original mitmproxy addon](https://github.com/Poeschl/Hassio-Addons) developed by Poeschl.
